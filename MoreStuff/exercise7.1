What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

/*
Exception handling catches errors from happening or atleast handles it in a way the prevents your program from crashing
it solves the problem of simple bugs from breaking your program completely.

Edit:
Uses try/catch statement
Lets programmer deal with problems in a way that makes sense, prevents catastrophy.
