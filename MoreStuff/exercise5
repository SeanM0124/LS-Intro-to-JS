What does the following function do?

function doSomething(string) {
  return string.split(' ').reverse().map((value) => value.length);
}

/*

takes string value as its arguement
.split(' ') seperates the string at any spaces (words), and places it into an array, returns array
.reverse() revereses the order of which the elements of an array are in
.map((value) => value.length) creates an new array of the lengths of the elements from the calling array

ultimately doSomething() will split a string by the words (spaces), reverse its order, then create and return an new array that consits of the words lengths
